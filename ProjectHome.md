**CouchTV** is a web application for managing your movie collection and building your tv channel.

Sit on your couch and relax, you'll never have to think again which was the last episode you have seen or which movie to watch: you can define channels and timetables with your own video and CouchTV keeps track of what you've seen.

CouchTV is written in Python and uses the Django framework.
